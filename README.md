# 2024 Front-End Best Practices and Coding Standards
A Manifesto of Development Practices

The Goal of this document is to an extenstion of industry standards best practices. This document also has my technical decisions and opinions over the most relevant alternatives as the time. 

## Agenda

## What should be in a Front-End Guidelines and Best Practices?

**Browser and platform targets** - 

**Rules for code annotation and documentation** -

**Mandatory performance initiatives** -

**Rubric For accessibility, security, and SEO Testing** - 

**CSS guidelines** - 

**File name and folder structure guidelines** - 

**Image and asset best practices** - 

## Is this document still necessary in 2024?

**Yes**, front-end guidelines and best practices are still relevant today. and here is why

**Consistency** - not only in the source code, but design and use experience

**Optimization** - developers are on the same page. Code reviews are much smoother, Easier to identify and address technical debt

**One Band One Sound** - makes it easier to adhere to company wide coding preferences and make the code readable to everyone.

## The Lay of the Land

## Pillars of Development

### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

### Performance

### Structure

#### Third Party Scripts

### Testing

#### Acceptance Criteria 

### Deployment

### Documentation
I follow **JSDoc** [https://jsdoc.app] and **TSDoc** [https://tsdoc.org] guidelines to annotate front end code.

I use **Swagger** [https://swagger.io] and **Postman** [https://www.postman.com] for service documentation. 

#### Release Notes
I use the **Semantic Versioning** [https://semver.org] standards for incrementing the code base.
Here is an overview:

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

**MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
**MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
**PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

### Product Road Mapping
#### Planning

#### Estimation
I prefer to use story points or function points over T-Shirt Size for estimation. Story points are ususally translated into measures of time such as hours. 1 point is defined as the time it takes to make the smallest correction such as a spelling correction, from development to deployment.
